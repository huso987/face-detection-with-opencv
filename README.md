# Face Detection with OpenCV

This repository contains a project that utilizes OpenCV to develop a face detection model. The model identifies and labels faces in images using Haar cascade classifiers.

## Features
- Detects faces in images
- Labels detected faces with bounding boxes
- Utilizes Haar cascade classifiers for face detection

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-detection-with-opencv.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd face-detection-with-opencv
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python
    ```

## Usage

1. Place your images in the project directory.
2. Update the `image_path` variable in the `detect_faces.py` script with the path to your image.
3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python detect_faces.py
    ```
